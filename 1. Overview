# Assignment-4  Data Analysis and Visualization with Airbnb and HR Datasets

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the data analysis and visualization of two datasets: Airbnb and HR. The analysis includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and creating visualizations using various libraries including `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, and `altair`.

## Airbnb Dataset Analysis

### Load and Clean Airbnb Data

The Airbnb dataset is loaded and cleaned by handling missing values and removing duplicates.

### Airbnb Data Visualization

Various visualizations are created to analyze the distribution and characteristics of the Airbnb data:

1. **Room Types Distribution**
    - Column: `room_type`
    - Representation: Bar chart (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
    - Purpose: To show the distribution of different room types available on Airbnb.

2. **Price Distribution**
    - Column: `price`
    - Representation: Histogram (seaborn, altair)
    - Purpose: To visualize the distribution of listing prices.

3. **Average Price by Neighbourhood**
    - Column: `price`, `neighbourhood`
    - Representation: Bar chart (matplotlib)
    - Purpose: To display the average price of listings in different neighbourhoods.

4. **Availability Distribution**
    - Column: `availability_365`
    - Representation: Histogram (seaborn)
    - Purpose: To show the distribution of availability days across listings.

5. **Reviews per Month**
    - Column: `reviews_per_month`
    - Representation: Histogram (seaborn)
    - Purpose: To visualize how frequently listings are reviewed on a monthly basis.

6. **Availability by Room Type**
    - Column: `availability_365`, `room_type`
    - Representation: Box plot (matplotlib)
    - Purpose: To show the availability distribution across different room types.

7. **Reviews Distribution by Room Type**
    - Column: `reviews_per_month`, `room_type`
    - Representation: Box plot (seaborn)
    - Purpose: To show the reviews distribution across different room types.

8. **Price vs. Availability**
    - Column: `price`, `availability_365`, `room_type`
    - Representation: Scatter plot (plotly)
    - Purpose: To visualize the relationship between price and availability.

9. **Room Types Distribution by Neighbourhood**
    - Column: `neighbourhood`, `room_type`
    - Representation: Stacked bar chart (matplotlib)
    - Purpose: To show the distribution of different room types by neighbourhood.

10. **Room Types Distribution by Price**
    - Column: `room_type`, `price`
    - Representation: Box plot (seaborn)
    - Purpose: To show the distribution of prices for different room types.

## HR Dataset Analysis

### Load and Clean HR Data

The HR dataset is loaded and cleaned by handling missing values and removing duplicates.

### HR Data Visualization

Various visualizations are created to analyze the distribution and characteristics of the HR data:

1. **Department Distribution**
    - Column: `Department`
    - Representation: Bar chart (matplotlib, plotly)
    - Purpose: To show the number of employees in each department.

2. **Gender Distribution**
    - Column: `Sex`
    - Representation: Pie chart (matplotlib, altair)
    - Purpose: To visualize the gender distribution of employees.

3. **Performance Scores Distribution**
    - Column: `PerformanceScore`
    - Representation: Bar chart (seaborn)
    - Purpose: To show the distribution of performance scores among employees.

4. **Salary Distribution**
    - Column: `Salary`
    - Representation: Histogram (seaborn)
    - Purpose: To visualize the distribution of employee salaries.

5. **Engagement Survey Scores**
    - Column: `EngagementSurvey`
    - Representation: Histogram (seaborn)
    - Purpose: To show the distribution of engagement survey scores among employees.

6. **Performance Score vs. Salary**
    - Column: `Salary`, `PerformanceScore`, `Department`
    - Representation: Scatter plot (plotly)
    - Purpose: To visualize the relationship between performance scores and salary.

7. **Salary Distribution by Department**
    - Column: `Salary`, `Department`
    - Representation: Box plot (matplotlib)
    - Purpose: To show the salary distribution across different departments.

8. **Engagement Survey vs. Performance Score**
    - Column: `EngagementSurvey`, `PerformanceScore`, `Department`
    - Representation: Scatter plot (altair)
    - Purpose: To visualize the relationship between engagement survey scores and performance scores.

9. **Department Distribution with Salary**
    - Column: `Department`, `Salary`
    - Representation: Box plot (seaborn)
    - Purpose: To show the salary distribution within each department.

10. **Gender Distribution with Performance Score**
    - Column: `Sex`, `PerformanceScore`
    - Representation: Box plot (seaborn)
    - Purpose: To show the distribution of performance scores among different genders.
